# NAEP_Automated_Scoring_of_2023-_NAEP_Math-_Items

To develop an automated scoring model for each NAEP math item, the whole model building process consists of two parts: feature extraction and model building. Before the process started, we pre-processed the raw text responses so that the decoding of the text data would be meaningful. Our modeling purely utilized information from student raw text responses. The quantification of the text response data was fulfilled via Natural Language Processing built in Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and extended BERT models. We explored different approaches to model building via deep learning algorithms, more specifically BERT, extended BERT models and the ensemble methods of multiple deep learning models including BERT and LSTM and CNN. Once we identified the best-performing model for each item, we reported SMD for subgroups for potential bias evaluation based on the best performing model for an item.
